# Learning ROS2
In this repository I will document my learning experience of ROS2. <br> 
https://www.udemy.com/course/ros2-for-beginners/ <br>
This is the udemy course that I'm following in this repo. <br>

## Purpose
I'm learning ROS2 because in my 5th semester of university I'll be a part of a team working on a project, which goal is 
to deliver a 3D mapping drone, using SLAM technology. <br> 
I have created a notes.txt file in which I'll be writing down important information that might turn out to be useful in the
actual project.
