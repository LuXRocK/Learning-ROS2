1. Command to build package and be able to change the code without rebuilding package: 
colcon build --symling-install

2. If --symlink-install doesen't work or there is any problem while building package that points to setuptools,
check setuptools version (pip3 list | grep setuptools) and if version is 59.6.0 downgrade to 58.2.0
(pip3 install setuptools==58.2.0). Also to use this flag the file containing the node (.py) has to be executable.

3. If you want to run the same node multiple times you need to change it's 
name. To do that use this command: 
ros2 run <package_name> <exec_name> --ros-args -r __node:=<new_name> 

4. rqt_graph lets you monitor all the active nodes in a visual representation
